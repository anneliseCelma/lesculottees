 On Solar Energy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
 Telkes is known for designed the first thermoelectric power generator in 1947
 and the first thermoelectric refrigerator in 1953 using the thermoelectric properties of
 Semiconductors.
 At that time, it is also solicited by the United States Government to join
 The Scientific Research and Development Office (OSRD). This experience is paramount

 The heat of the sun is concentrated to evaporate the water, leaving behind salt and others
 Solids. In the middle of the World War II, this creation is a boon because it is
 Essential for lifeboats and also increases drinking water reserves on the islands

 In 1948, Maria Telkes built with Eleanor Raymond The Dover House in Massachusetts.
 This house is the first house whose heating system is fully powered by

     It is by an icy cold in New York in the early 1900s that Mary Anderson had an idea
     Great. She traveled in a trolleybus through the city and the melted snow fell on the
     windshield, so much so that the driver had to keep the windows open to see
     correctly and, sometimes, stop the trolleybus completely to clear the snow.Mary is quickly
     realized that many other road users knew similar problems and
     It is then that the idea of ​​the wiper brushes came to him. She imagined a manual device
     comprising a lever inside the vehicle, connected to a spring arm with a blade in
     Rubber that supports the outside of the windshield. The lever would have a counterweight for
     Ensure that the wipers remains in contact with the windshield and, once the lever turned, the
     Blade would sweep glass, eliminating snow, crackle and rain. This notion would allow

     However, Mary\'s wiper brooms have not been an immediate success. In 1905, she tries
     to sell the rights of his model to a Canadian company, but without success - the industry
     Do not appreciate their value.
     Charlotte Bridgwood, she, is president of the "Bridgwood Manufacturing Company" in New York, has
    Prosecuted the development of windshield wipers. Resuming the original manual design, introduced
    For the first time by Mary Anderson, Charlotte designed the first automatic windshield wipers to
    online order.
    This invention, baptized "Storm Windshield Cleaner", uses rollers instead of blades and has been
    patented in 1917. However, its conception is also not a commercial success and its patent
    Expires in 1920. None of the two women had qualifications in mechanics or engineering. They have
